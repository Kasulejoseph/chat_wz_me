# This  project is still under development.. 
chat wix me is a simple chatbot am currently developing and after its final stages of development it will able to provide
an effective real time speak conversation with people as well as alerting for any updates(climate chages,forex bereau,football results etc) to the user interested in that information.
At it's early stages of development, the chat bot is just using the given dataset('english') and speak the respond to the user.
for any information requested from outside the dataset('english') the bot can not provide a reliable response to the user.
for that matter i want to provide the bot with a world wide dataset('internet'). am hoping to do this by scraping 
the most searched web pages for each information categories(sports, music, politics, library, culture etc) and extract
only the requested information for the user instantly.
for example if i want the meaning of some word, then the bot will search in dictionary.com or wikipedia.org and speaks 
back the answer.
